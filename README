Radiant Vcard Part Extension
----------------------------

This extension builds on Josh French's PageParts extension.
It adds a new page part type "VcardPagePart", which aids in making valid hCard-formatted markup.

## Still to do

* Revise markup and/or CSS for backend; make things look better.
* Revise attributes; are these really all of the most-used fields when displaying addresses?
* Make vcard fields dynamic? I.e. so someone can add more than 1 URL or telephone number.
